# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

## Certificate: https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0011145612753
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Datacamp. 

Datacamp data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in R and its data analysis libraries (tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr, naniar) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.

# Project 1: Level Difficulty in Candy Crush Saga

Candy Crush Saga is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world.

In this Project, we will get to work with a real Candy Crush dataset and use this data to estimate level difficulty. This Project assumes we can manipulate data frames using dplyr and make plots using ggplot2.

Project Tasks

    1. Candy Crush Saga
    2. The data set
    3. Checking the data set
    4. Computing level difficulty
    5. Plotting difficulty profile
    6. Spotting hard levels
    7. Computing uncertainty
    8. Showing uncertainty
    9. A final metric
    10. Should our level designer worry?

# Project 2: Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey

Project Description

Before starting this project, we should be comfortable manipulating data frames and have some experience working with the tidyverse packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2.

This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey dataset. If you want to know more about the tools and techniques Kaggle participants use, check out the full report of the Kaggle 2017 survey results.

Project Tasks

    1. Welcome to the world of data science
    2. Using multiple tools
    3. Counting users of each tool
    4. Plotting the most popular tools
    5. The R vs Python debate
    6. Plotting R vs Python users
    7. Language recommendations
    8. The most recommended language by the language used
    9. The moral of the story

# Project 3: Rise and Fall of Programming Languages

Project Description

How can you tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that you can tell which are most worth investing time in? One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. 

By measuring the number of questions about each technology, you can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. In this project, you'll use open data from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and Javascript have changed over time.

Project Tasks

    1. Data on tags over time
    2. Now in fraction format
    3. Has R been growing or shrinking?
    4. Visualizing change over time
    5. How about dplyr and ggplot2?
    6. What are the most asked-about tags?
    7. How have large programming languages changed over time?
    8. Some more tags!

# Project 4: Scout your Athletics Fantasy Team

Project Description

If you were scouting out an athletics team, you would need to know more than just how far each person has jumped or thrown once. You want to know who is the most consistent, who fouls the least and who comes through in the clutch. And you will need to decide which aspects are most important to you so you can find the right balance.

In this R project, you will use dataframes and the dplyr package to find out who you should put on your team, and in doing so become the next "Moneyball" star manager of an athletics team.

You will use performance data collated from jumps and throws events in the US from 2013-2017.

Project Tasks

    1. Athletics needs a new breed of scouts and managers
    2. Managers love tidy data
    3. Every throw matters
    4. Find the clutch performers
    5. Pull the pieces together for a new look at the athletes
    6. Normalize the data to compare across stats
    7. What matters most when building your squad?
    8. Get to know your players
    9. Make your case to the front office
    10. Time to throw down

# Project 5: Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy

Project Description

Do women live longer than men? How long? Does it happen everywhere? Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere? Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest? In this project, you will answer all these questions by manipulating and visualizing United Nations life expectancy data using ggplot2.

The dataset can be found here and contains the average life expectancies of men and women by country (in years). It covers four periods: 1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005.

Project Tasks

    1. United Nations life expectancy data
    2. Life expectancy of men vs. women by country
    3. Visualize I
    4. Reference lines I
    5. Plot titles and axis labels
    6. Highlighting remarkable countries I
    7. How has life expectancy by gender evolved?
    8. Visualize II
    9. Reference lines II
    10. Highlighting remarkable countries II
