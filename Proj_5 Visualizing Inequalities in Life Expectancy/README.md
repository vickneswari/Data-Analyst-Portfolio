# Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy

Project Description

Do women live longer than men? How long? Does it happen everywhere? Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere? Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest? In this project, you will answer all these questions by manipulating and visualizing United Nations life expectancy data using ggplot2.

The dataset can be found here and contains the average life expectancies of men and women by country (in years). It covers four periods: 1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005.
