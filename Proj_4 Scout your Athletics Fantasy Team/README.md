# Scout your Athletics Fantasy Team

If you were scouting out an athletics team, you would need to know more than just how far each person has jumped or thrown once. You want to know who is the most consistent, who fouls the least and who comes through in the clutch. And you will need to decide which aspects are most important to you so you can find the right balance.

In this R project, you will use dataframes and the dplyr package to find out who you should put on your team, and in doing so become the next "Moneyball" star manager of an athletics team.

You will use performance data collated from jumps and throws events in the US from 2013-2017.
